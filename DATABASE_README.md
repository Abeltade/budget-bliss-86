# BudgetMaster Database Schema

This document outlines the core data structure for the BudgetMaster personal finance application, designed to support **zero-based budgeting**, detailed transaction tracking, and goal-based savings.

## Core Philosophy: Zero-Based Budgeting

The application follows a zero-based budgeting approach where:
- **All income must be allocated** to expenses, savings, or goals
- The target is to reach a **net balance of $0.00** in budget allocation
- Every dollar has a purpose before the month begins
- **Starting balances are $0.00** - users must manually input their financial data

## Database Tables

## Zero-Based Budgeting Workflow

1. **Setup Phase (Month Start):**
   - User inputs expected income for the month
   - User allocates 100% of income across categories using `budget_limits`
   - Goal: Total allocated = Total expected income

2. **Transaction Tracking:**
   - Every transaction is recorded with type, category, and amount
   - Transfers move money between accounts without affecting budget
   - Contributions to savings goals are tracked via `goal_contributions`

3. **Daily/Weekly/Monthly Views:**
   - **Daily View:** Shows today's income, expenses, and net balance
   - **Weekly View:** Rolling 7-day summary with navigation
   - **Monthly View:** Primary budgeting screen showing allocated vs spent per category

4. **Target Achievement:**
   - Unallocated income should reach $0.00
   - Every dollar has a purpose (spending, savings, or debt)
   - Overspending in one category requires reallocation from another
